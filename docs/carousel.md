# Carousel

Very tentatively we've added a carousel layout. It's very new so there may still be problems.

You can access the carousel by adding a new `image-layout` processor to your project. The `carousel` layout is a new option.

\```image-layout

\```

Going forward you'll be able to pick a bunch of options for image layouts in this way, for now,
there is two options, a carousel with or without images.

This will give you either, a carousel with or without thumbnails.
